## #8 Stella Maxwell | Camp: Notes on Fashion
### Moschino by Jeremy Scott

Stella Maxwell’s Camp gown was stunning. It’s not my favourite for the theme, but I’m a sucker for glitter, stars, and head-to-toe mesh, so I couldn’t leave this one out of the mix.

## #7 Yolanda Hadid | Art of the In-Between
### Tommy Hilfiger

Yolanda looked fierce as hell in her mid-50s. She managed to look somewhere between modest (with the long sleeves, long hem, and high neckline) and risqué. Plus the cutouts and mesh had a COMME des GARçONS vibe and I'm all about sticking to the themes.

## #6 Naomi Campbell | Fashion in the Age of Technology
### Roberto Cavalli Couture

THE QUEEN HERSELF! Naomi Campbell's 2016 gown was perfect for the theme. The intricate, metallic beading was a nice nod to technology while the severe cutouts were *very* on-trend for the time. At the end of the day, though, you simply can't go past how beautifully designed and constructed this gown is.

## #5 Karolina Kurkova | Impossible Conversations
### Rachel Zoe Couture

The Met Gala Ball is the only time of year that you can dress up like a gigantic disco ball and be praised for it. Karolina Kurkova took full advantage of it and I'm HERE FOR IT. That is all.

## #4 Cara Delevingne | Punk: Chaos to Couture
### Burberry

Even though this is sitting at #4, it's actually my all time favourite Met Gala look. Ever. Everything The dress is perfect for the theme; the silhouette is simple and elegant, while the deep plunge & heavy studding gives it a super badass punk look. Cara's eye black smokey eye, black nailpolish, and half-back hair completes the look. It's 7 years later and I'm still obsessed.

## #3 JLo | China: Through the Looking Glass
### Verace

Another gown that does a great job at sticking to the theme. Another celebrity taking their one opportunity per year to dress in an absolutely outrageous costume. This outfit is *very* Versace. The colour, design, and shape of the dress are all beautiful. If I'm honest, though, I think I'm just a huge sucker for the dragon-over-tulle detail because it was the key detail 2 years earlier in my 2013 BFA(Fashion) porfolio. Although this whole outfit is *beautiful*, it would've been much nicer to see JLo choose to go with a Chinese fashion designer for the still-controversial (and not totally okay) theme.

## #2 Alexander McQueen | AngloMania: Tradition and Transgression in British Fashion
### Alexander McQueen

Some would say that Sarah Jessica Parker is the star of this shot, but they would be wrong. I cannot stress this enough: 👏 Alexander 👏 McQueen 👏 IS 👏 this 👏 theme 👏👏👏👏👏👏
  
Many of his designs were traditional and elegant, drawing on the history of Britain, while also managing to shock and offend the audience. This specific look is a big hint to his infamous 1995 show, "Highland Rape". His kilt is traditional, he is a transgression.

## #1 Naomi Campbell | Haute Couture
### Versace

I'm not even going to try to put words here; nothing I say about this look will add value.

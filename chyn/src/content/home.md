Hello!! I'm Chynna â€“ an Australian living in NYC. I've created this website because:

+ I'm bored
+ I'm a software engineer & software engineers need their own website, right??


The people/pictures above are really just there to make this page look pretty, but they do a good job at summing up the things I love and who I am. From left to right: Alexander McQueen SS'99 show, Abby Sciutto (NCIS), Margaret Hamilton, Alexander McQueen, Matt Groening.
